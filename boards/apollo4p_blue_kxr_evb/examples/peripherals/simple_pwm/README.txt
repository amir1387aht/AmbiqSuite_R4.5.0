============
 Simple PWM Output Example



Purpose:
========
This example shows how to setup and start a pwm output
 This is a PWM with a fixed duty cycle.

 NOTE: This example shows a low power operation using reduced DTCM size
 The 8K size is very near the limit with most BSPs.
 The standard stack size had to be slightly reduced for this example's
 RAM use to fit in 8K.(with IAR compiler)

 //! Printing takes place over the ITM at 1M Baud.
