Description:
============
 sdio wifi interface read and write example.




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates how to blocking DMA read & write
          APIs with WiFi device.

Additional Information:
=======================
 To enable debug printing, add the following project-level macro definitions.

 AM_DEBUG_PRINTF

 When defined, debug messages will be sent over ITM/SWO at 1M Baud.

 Note that when these macros are defined, the device will never achieve deep
 sleep, only normal sleep, due to the ITM (and thus the HFRC) being enabled.
