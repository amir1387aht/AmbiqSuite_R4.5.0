21Jun2024 Revision release_sdk_4_5_0-a1ef3b89f9

This is a combined release supporting updates to Apollo4/Apollo4 Blue,
Apollo4 Plus/Apollo4 BLue Plus Rev C0 (KBR/KXR devices), and Apollo4 Lite /Apollo4 Blue Lite.

**********************************************************************************************

SDK supports all Apollo4 evaluation boards from Ambiq.
- Apollo4 EVB (/boards/apollo4b_evb)
- Apollo4 Blue EVB (/boards/apollo4b_blue_evb)
- Apollo4 EVB with Rev 1 Display Shield (/boards/apollo4b_evb_disp_shield)
- Apollo4 Lite EVB (/boards/apollo4l_evb)
- Apollo4 Lite Blue EVB (/boards/apollo4l_blue_evb)
- Apollo4 Plus EVB (/boards/apollo4p_evb)
- Apollo4 Plus Blue KBR EVB (/boards/apollo4p_blue_kbr_evb)
- Apollo4 Plus Blue KXR EVB (/boards/apollo4p_blue_kxr_evb)
- Apollo4 Plus EVB with Rev 2 Display Shield (/boards/apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev2)

SDK includes a number of predefined examples for each configuration. See the file in /docs/List_of_Examples.txt. 

SDK includes pre-built graphics examples using the Embedded Wizard (Tara Systems) GUI-Builder tool. These can be 
found at boards/apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev2/examples/graphics.  Support for this tool can be found at:
https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/getting-started-apollo4plus-display-kit?v=13.00

IDE/ToolChain Support:
----------------------
AmbiqSuite SDK supports GCC, IAR, Keil and Segger IDEs.
Support for older Keil/ARMCC 5060750 has been deprecated.
This release has been tested with:

- GCC 13.2.1 20231009 [Arm GNU Toolchain 13.2.Rel1 based on GCC 13.2]
- IAR ANSI C/C++ Compiler V9.40.2.374/W64 for ARM
- ARMCC 6190004 [Keil V5.38a using ArmClang V6.19]
- GCC SEGGER-CC 16.0.9 [Embedded Studio v8.10d released 2024-03-25]

* A .vscode folder with a sample configuration is included in the hello_world and tinyusb_cdc_msc_freertos examples, setup for apollo4p.
  A Visual Studio Code quickstart guide is provided to help get the prepackaged configuration running on your environment. Please see 
  the Visual Studio Code Quickstart Guide in /docs/AmbiqSuite Visual Studio Code Project Example Quick Start Guide_v1p0.pdf.

* For IAR EWARM, Apollo4 is natively supported with EWARM v9.10.2 and later. Apollo4 Plus is natively supported
  in v9.32.1 or later. Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite are natively supported with EWARM v9.40.2 and later.

* For Keil MDK, Apollo4 is supported by installing the CMSIS Ambiq Pack v1.2.9 or later. Apollo4 Plus is supported in
  v1.3.0. Apollo4 Lite is supported in CMSIS Ambiq Pack v1.4.1. 
  
* All of the Apollo4 family, including Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite, are natively supported with 
  Segger J-Link Version V7.96l (2024-06-12) and later.

* By default, Apollo4 Plus projects in this release select the AMAP42KP-KBR device. Other
  Apollo4 Plus devices are also supported.

Notes:
------
* Provisioning and image tools for Apollo4 Plus and Apollo4 Blue Plus use the same infrastructure as Apollo4.
  Use tools/apollo4b_scripts for the same.
* Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite use the provisioning and image tools in tools/apollo4l_scripts folder.
  
Known Issues:
-------------
* The coremark and nemagfx_vc_circular_bar examples are only provided for GCC, IAR, and Keil6.
* The tempco example is incompatible with some Apollo4p EVBs which contain earlier trim revision devices. Trim revision 6 or later is required.
* The Power examples for Apollo4p EVBs will also result in sub-optimal power performance unless trim revision 6 or later devices are used.
